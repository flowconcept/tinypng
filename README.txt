INTRODUCTION
------------
Provides TinyPNG integration for Drupal 7.
 
What does TinyPNG do?
TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your
PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer
bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it
makes a very large difference in file size!

Why should I use TinyPNG?
PNG is useful because it's the only widely supported format that can store
partially transparent images. The format uses compression, but the files can
still be large. Use TinyPNG to shrink images for your apps and sites. It will
use less bandwidth and load faster.
